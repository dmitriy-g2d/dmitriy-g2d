# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Dmitry

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a beginner learning how to code â€” and Iâ€™m sharing everything I try.

I run a YouTube channel called **Grok To Developer**.  
I make voiceless videos where I:

- Learn C++ from scratch  
- Use AI tools like Grok and ChatGPT 
- Solve beginner problems and build fun things  
- Show real code, real bugs, and real progress

If you're also learning or just curious â€” you're not alone!  
Letâ€™s grow together ðŸ’»ðŸš€
